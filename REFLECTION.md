Reflection:
I should have read the entire assessment before starting to code. I was too eager to start, and therefore I missed some steps and had to correct them.
I should maybe write/draw an overview of the app, before coding.
I should take frequent walks, with much fresh air. I push myself too much to get the code right, and lose focus because of it. If I'm stuck, I shouldn't start writing more complicated code to solve the problem, I should take a step back instead.
